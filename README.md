Application Testing Scenarios

1.	Test if setting an upper limit is smaller than the lower limit then an error is thrown.
2.	Test if the key/value pairs passed to the primary method is null then an error is thrown.
3.	Test if the key/value pairs object has no items inside that an error is thrown.

In a more robust scenario I would likely want to return the data written out as an object and then test that the output matches the expected result.
